# Introduction 
MyAPICalls is a sample app that enables users to walk through the process of executing DocuSign API calls and review:
* The JSON request body structure
* The values of request properties
* The API request thatâ€™s sent to the Docusign platform
* The API response
* Objects created in the Docusign platform as a result of an API call

Each scenario in the sample app illustrates a different use case, such as creating an envelope from a template or creating a Connect configuration and receiving a Connect event. A scenario consists of a series of API calls. You can execute them one by one to see how each call is constructed, or you can run the entire scenario and review the results.

MyAPICalls includes the option to execute scenarios multiple times with unique data for each execution. This feature is useful for quickly populating a developer account with test data.
